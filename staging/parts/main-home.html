        <p>This astounding philanthropic milestone is an achievement that deserves celebration. I am proud of what our donor community has accomplished together on behalf of the University of Cincinnati and UC Health. While celebrating this transformative number, we want to thank and recognize every single donor who contributed. Nearly 90% of gifts that contributed to this $2 billion total were under $1,000.</p>
